#+TITLE: ds-vault: Encrypted Password Vault for Emacs
#+AUTHOR: DeadSwitch | The Cyber Ghost
#+OPTIONS: toc:nil

* Overview

=ds-vault= is a minimal, hardened Emacs Lisp utility for encrypting, decrypting, and managing a KeePassXC-compatible password database using GnuPG.

It uses the external =gpg= command for maximal control, auditability, and OPSEC transparency.

DeadSwitch does not trust abstractions. This vault is silent, verifiable, and self-destructing by design.

* Why External GPG?

DeadSwitch uses raw =gpg= intentionally:

- Full Transparency: You see every step. No hidden agents.
- Cross-Tool Compatibility: Decrypt from the terminal if Emacs disappears.
- No Trust in Caching: Explicit keys, explicit files, explicit logic.
- Real Signing Flow: =--sign= + =--encrypt= = your data is yours alone.

* Installation

1. Clone or copy this repo.
2. Add it to your =load-path=:

   #+begin_src elisp
   (add-to-list 'load-path "/path/to/ds-vault/")
   (require 'ds-vault)
   #+end_src

3. Create a config file (=ds-vault-config.el=) that defines:

   #+begin_src elisp
   (defvar ds/key-id "YOUR-GPG-KEY-ID")
   (defvar ds/clear-db "/path/to/vault.kdbx")
   (defvar ds/encrypted-db "/path/to/vault.kdbx.gpg")
   (defvar ds/backup-dir "/path/to/backups/")
   (defvar ds/timestamp (format-time-string "%Y%m%d-%H%M%S"))
   #+end_src

* Usage

Call the commands from =M-x= or bind them to keys.

| Command            | Description                             |
|--------------------+-----------------------------------------|
| =ds/encrypt-vault= | Encrypt and sign the vault              |
| =ds/decrypt-vault= | Decrypt the vault                       |
| =ds/vault-status=  | Check if vault is sealed or exposed     |
| =ds/backup-vault=  | Backup the encrypted vault with version |
| =ds/vault-help=    | Show usage instructions                 |

* Status Output

The status check is brutally honest:

- Vault is ENCRYPTED — you're good.
- Vault is PLAIN TEXT — seal it now.
- Insecure state — both files exist. Fix it.
- No vault files found — nothing to protect... yet.

* Philosophy

DeadSwitch believes encryption should be:

- Explicit
- Reversible
- Offline-friendly
- Not reliant on agents or GUIs

This vault reflects that mindset.

* Example Workflow

#+begin_src emacs-lisp
M-x ds/vault-status
M-x ds/encrypt-vault
M-x ds/backup-vault
M-x ds/decrypt-vault
#+end_src

* License

MIT — because freedom includes the freedom to vanish.
